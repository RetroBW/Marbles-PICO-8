# Marbles - Written for PICO-8

Inspired by SegaSoft's Lose Your Marbles released for Microsoft Windows on August 19, 1997. In this version you will try to match colors of 3 or more marbles in the center row. Left and right buttons will shift the marble column select cursor. Up and down buttons will shift the selected column of marbles up or down. The X and O buttons will rotate the center row of marbles. A level is completed when a single column of marbles is emptied. The game is over when a single column of marbles is filled. Hope you enjoy it!<br>
